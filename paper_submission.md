# Paper Submission

### Instructions for Authors

For preparation of papers please follow the instructions for authors available at the Springer LNCS Web page.

We solicit three types of papers in the [LNCS format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines):
- Full research papers (16 pages, excluding references)
- Short research papers (10 pages, excluding references) – These "early-innovation" papers are work-in-progress papers and these will be reviewed with an emphasis on novelty/originality of the idea.
- Blue sky ideas (up to 16 pages, excluding references) – These papers have the same scope of the blue sky ideas track of AAMAS 2025 (see [https://aamas2025.org/index.php/conference/calls/call-for-blue-sky-ideas/](https://aamas2025.org/index.php/conference/calls/call-for-blue-sky-ideas/)), focussing on the COINE topics


All papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF format. __*Information about the paper type should be included at the end of the title of the paper – (Full), (Short) or (Blue Sky ideas).*__

For submission of papers, please use the OpenReview.net site at: [https://openreview.net/group?id=ifaamas.org/AAMAS/2025/Workshop/COINE](https://openreview.net/group?id=ifaamas.org/AAMAS/2025/Workshop/COINE)

Submitted papers will be reviewed on a "single-blind" basis by at least two PC members.

Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the workshop to present the work. Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work in person by default. Exceptions may be granted by the organizing committee on a case-by-case basis, and authors who receive such exceptions may present their work online, provided they register for the workshop. Presentations will be delivered in the Eastern Time Zone.

### Proceedings

As with previous COIN(E) workshops, COINE intends to publish post-proceedings in Springer's LNCS series (pending confirmation). Authors will be invited to submit revised and extended versions of their paper for consideration in these post-proceedings.

Revised papers must take into account the discussion held during the workshop; hence, only papers that are presented during the workshop will be considered for inclusion in the post-proceedings volume.
